# GA WDI-34  Project #3: A MEAN stack Application
## 'What's in your fridge?'

 What's in your fridge application has been designed and developed by Linda Le, Rachel Dolan and Natasha Ramburrun. The idea is that users can search on the app for recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home, for convenience and to cut down on wastage.

 The project was planned using the project management tool trello, and we devised the user experience using wireframes on draw.io.  

 #### App development


Our application was built around the spoonacular API which was central to our idea. Using this API allowed us to search by ingredients and list all the relevant recipes. The API also enables the user to filter by their dietary requirements as well as using autocomplete functionality to make the process of searching smoother and avoid incorrect data from being inputted.

 We created an app which includes the REStful routes allowing the user to be able to register and login in with authentication. The user can log on to their profile page, create and delete comments/ratings and favourite and unfavourite recipes.

 #### Challenges

Initially we wanted to be able to sort recipes based on the number of missing or included ingredients, but too late into the project we realised that the type of request we were making didn't include this information. We were able to include it in a subsequent request made to the API based on an individual recipe.

However, we were able to still include this information and instead we were able to add another filter feature which allows the user to input any dietary requirements, including pescatarian, gluten-free etc.

Throughout the process we also encountered some challenges using the API, including incorrect and inconsistent data.
